## run locally

you need [node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager. (npm should work fine too).

1. install dependencies via `pnpm install` or `npm install`.
2. run the app via `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev`.
3. visit `http://localhost:5173`

i made this animation for myself only to record the screen with no intention to deploy it on a website. naturally, i did not care about the performace as long as it would run smoothly on my computer. so i'm unsure how it might run or look on your device.

the short animation [particle dreams (1988)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QEp-oPaQto) by karl sims was a big inspiration to me for create this video.
